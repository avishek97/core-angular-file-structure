15. selector value should be mentioned inside any html file if new component is generated within same module then the selector value should be mentioned
wihtin the html file after which that component to be displayed.
templateUrls contains local file url of the html file of that module. ex- in app module app.component.html selector should be mentioned in index.html and if new component will be made then the value of the selector will be mentioned inside app.component.html
styleUrls contains call the style sheet path.
